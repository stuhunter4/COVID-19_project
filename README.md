# Los Angeles vs. San Francisco (Counties)
<p>Two urban centers in the state of California have shown drastically different COVID-19 trajectories; in particular regarding testing, cases, deaths, and hospitalizations.</p>
<p>For this project we did an exploratory analysis into some of these and other differences between the two counties, and attempted to draw some conclusions from the data we found.</p>
<p>For my part, I have included the Jupyter notebooks used to: extract data using Python API requests, processed different types of data files into clean dataframes with Pandas, then generated some of the visualizations we used in our presentation, via Matplotlib.</p>
